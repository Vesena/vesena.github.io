            Since childhood I have admired horses - their strength, beauty and character. I had a beautiful album telling the story and breeds of horses. On this page I want to share with you the embodiment of freedom and passion.

            The <b>horse</b> (<i><b>Equus ferus caballus</b></i>) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication" title="Wiki page about Domestication" target="_blank">domesticated</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd-toed_ungulate" title="Wiki page about Odd-toed ungulate" target="_blank">one-toed</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungulate" title="Wiki page about Ungulate" target="_blank">hoofed mammal</a>. It belongs to the taxonomic family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equidae" title="Wiki page about Equidae" target="_blank">Equidae</a> and is one of two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extant_taxon" title="Wiki page about Extant taxon" target="_blank">extant</a>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies" title="Wiki page about Subspecies" target="_blank">subspecies</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_horse" title="Wiki page about Wild horse" target="_blank"><i>Equus ferus</i></a>. The horse has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_horse" title="Wiki page about Evolution of the horse" target="_blank">evolved</a> over the past 45 to 55&nbsp;million years from a small multi-toed creature, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eohippus" title="Wiki page about Eohippus" target="_blank">Eohippus</a></i>, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era" title="Wiki page about Common Era" target="_blank">BCE</a>, and their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_the_horse" title="Wiki page about Domestication of the horse" target="_blank">domestication</a> is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE. Horses in the subspecies <i>caballus</i> are
            domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_horse" title="Wiki page about Feral horse" target="_blank">feral horses</a>. These feral populations are not true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_horse" title="Wiki page about Wild horse" target="_blank">wild horses</a>, which are horses that never have been domesticated. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equine_anatomy" title="Wiki page about Equine anatomy" target="_blank">anatomy</a> to life stages, size, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equine_coat_color" title="Wiki page about Equine coat color" target="_blank">colors</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_markings" title="Wiki page about Horse markings" target="_blank">markings</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_breed" title="Wiki page about Horse breed" target="_blank">breeds</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gait" title="Wiki page about Horse gait" target="_blank">locomotion</a>, and behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            Horses are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursorial" title="Wiki page about Cursorial" target="_blank">adapted to run</a>, allowing them to quickly escape predators, and possess a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_balance" title="Wiki page about Sense of balance" target="_blank">sense of balance</a> and a strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response" title="Wiki page about Fight-or-flight response" target="_blank">fight-or-flight response</a>. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults. Female horses, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare" title="Wiki page about Mare" target="_blank">mares</a>, carry their young for approximately 11&nbsp;months and a young horse, called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foal" title="Wiki page about Foal" target="_blank">foal</a>, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle" title="Wiki page about Saddle" target="_blank">saddle</a> or in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_harness" title="Wiki page about Horse harness" target="_blank">harness</a> between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30&nbsp;years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_horse" title="Wiki page about Draft horse" target="_blank">draft horses</a> and some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pony" title="Wiki page about Pony" target="_blank">ponies</a>, suitable for slow, heavy work; and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warmblood" title="Wiki page about Warmblood" target="_blank">warmbloods</a>", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300&nbsp;breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits as well as in working activities such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mounted_police" title="Wiki page about Mounted police" target="_blank">police work</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_animal" title="Wiki page about Working animal" target="_blank">agriculture</a>, entertainment, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equine-assisted_therapy" title="Wiki page about Equine-assisted therapy" target="_blank">therapy</a>. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism" title="Wiki page about Equestrianism" target="_blank">riding</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_(horse)" title="Wiki page about Driving (horse)" target="_blank">driving</a> techniques developed, using many different styles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_tack" title="Wiki page about Horse tack" target="_blank">equipment</a> and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_meat" title="Wiki page about Horse meat" target="_blank">meat</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_milk" title="Wiki page about Horse milk" target="_blank">milk</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsehide" title="Wiki page about Horsehide" target="_blank">hide</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsehair" title="Wiki page about Horsehair" target="_blank">hair</a>, bone, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premarin" title="Wiki page about Premarin" target="_blank">pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares</a>.
